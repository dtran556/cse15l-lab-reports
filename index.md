# Lab Report 3
Today we will be talking about the command line command `grep` and its different uses. We will be using the written_2 directory from week 4 lab.


## Command line command : `grep -r ""`
The `grep -r ""` command allows you to go into a directory and find the path that contains the string arguement that the user passes in and provide the context in which the string was mentioned
Example 1: 
```
[cs15lwi23aun@ieng6-201]:skill-demo1-data:327$ grep -r "hello"
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToHongKong.txt:        the local people smile “hello” and, if you’re lucky, point you to a
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt:        (or Ca’ Grande), while gondoliers claim Othello’s Desdemona lived in
```

Example 2:
```
[cs15lwi23aun@ieng6-201]:skill-demo1-data:331$ grep -r "please"
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/CH4.txt:In this sense, make-believe is not really “free play,” as we often assume it to be. Instead, its very essence is self-restraint—voluntarily following social rules. While pretending, Vygotsky explained, children repeatedly face conﬂicts between the rules of the make-believe situation and what they would do if they could act impulsively, and they usually decide in favor of the rules. When tired, Sophie’s teddy bear and leprechaun don’t stay up late doing just as they please. Instead, they obey their caregivers and go to bed. With only one lollipop, or paciﬁer, to go around, teddy bear and leprechaun share. They don’t quarrel and grab, and if they had done so, Sophie or another make-believe character probably would have intervened and insisted on kind, considerate behavior.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Berk/CH4.txt:As children engage in play talk, they not only build their vocabularies but correct one another’s errors, either directly or by demonstrating the acceptable way to speak. In one instance, a kindergartner enacting a telephone conversation said, “Hello, come to my house, please.” Her play partner quickly countered with appropriate telephone greeting behavior: “No, ﬁrst you’ve got to say ‘How are you? What are you doing?’”28
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch10.txt:The significant feature of our basic freedoms—apart from the franchise and those that arise in the criminal process—is that we can imagine enjoying all of them in a state of nature. We do not need government in order to exercise our freedom of speech or religion, to bear arms or to be free of state intrusion in our homes. As these rights are formulated, government acquires the image of the interloper, the enemy, the potential violator of our freedom to do as we please.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/ch6.txt:No one chose to create an American nation consisting of North and South, white and black, native and immigrant, and there were undoubtedly many people displeased by the idea. Yet, this was the situation in which we found ourselves in 1863. Lincoln had conceived of rooting our history in the identity generated by the struggle for independence. History had forged a unique nation of people of diverse origins. Justice Harlan understood what the nation had become and what it could do to further its own internal harmony. His magisterial dissent leaves us with a historical record of what constitutional thought in the postbellum period could have been.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt:In the summer of 1997, NASA was busy attempting to formulate what it came to call “astrobiology,” an attempt to understand the origin, evolution, and characteristics of life anywhere in the universe. Astrobiology does not yet exist = it is a field in the birthing process. Whatever the area comes to be called as it matures, it seems likely to be a field of spectacular success and deep importance in the coming century. A hint of the potential impact of astrobiology came in August 1997 with the tentative but excited reports of a Martian meteorite found in Antarctica that, NASA scientists announced, might have evidence of early Martian microbial life. The White House organized the single-day “Space Conference,” to which I was pleased to be invited. Perhaps thirty-five scientists and scholars gathered in the Old Executive OYce Building for a meeting led by Vice President Gore. The vice president began the meeting with a rather unexpected question to the group: If it should prove true that the Martian rock actually harbored fossilized microbial life, what would be the least interesting result? 
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch5.txt:But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol-sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner, that sequence of events seems laden with semantics. If only the bacterium could tell us: “Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me? I’ve run into that one before! I ducked under a boulder, and he never sensed me. I made it home. Pass me some more glucose please, Martha.”

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToItaly.txt:        politeness is important, per favore (please), grazie (thank you), prego
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bahamas-WhereToGo.txt:Head back to the main coast road and you will find two small cays lying immediately offshore. The first is Arawak Cay, home to the local fishing fleet. A number of colorful shacks line the approach road where you can buy conch and fried fish, always fresh and always delicious. Weekends can be busy with local families. Travel through Arawak Cay to reach Silver Cay, where there is a small resort with a pretty beach. Here you will find Crystal Cay, site of a marine park where you can take a close look at the undersea world without getting wet. A man-made coral reef has been created on the sea bottom and you can watch all the marine activity from an underwater observatory. The reef attracts many kinds of aquatic creatures that are free to come and go as they please. The observatory looks decidedly futuristic and can be seen quite clearly from the road as you travel along the coast. Other activities at Crystal Cay include a sea turtle environment, a touch pool where you can stroke a sting ray or pet a conch, and a snorkel trail, if you want to get into the water yourself.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhatToDo.txt:Parasailing is also available, but please make sure that you are fully insured before taking to the air. Many policies exclude this popular activity.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Bermuda-WhatToDo.txt:Prices for brands that you have at home might not be cheaper than at your local store, so please undertake some research before you leave for your trip.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Canada-WhereToGo.txt:The queen Latinized in the provincial capital’s name is, of course, Victoria. The city’s decorum would please her. It’s been cleaned up considerably since the first settlers arrived in the 1880s and found the banks of the Wascana Creek littered with hundreds of buffalo bones. Indian hunters used to dry their buffalo meat and stretch the hides by the creek, and left the bones in a heap. The town was known as Pile of Bones until they were ground up for fertilizer.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Cuba-History.txt:A centralized, all-powerful state didn’t please all Cubans. The media were soon placed under state control, promised elections were never held, and Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDRs) were established to keep tabs on dissenters. In the early years of the revolution, tens of thousands of people suspected of being unsympathetic to its goals were detained, imprisoned, or sent to labor camps, along with such other “undesirables” as homosexuals and priests.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhatToDo.txt:Dasain honors the tiger-riding goddess Durga and her defeat of the buffalo-demon Mahisasura, a feat symbolic of good defeating evil. This holiday, which follows the monsoon, is a time for renewal, including scrubbing the house, wearing new clothes, and taking purification baths by starlight at different river locations, followed by temple visits with puja offerings of food, colored powders, and flowers. All over the country, children fly kites during Dasain, and primitive wooden Ferris wheels or swings suspended from four stout bamboo poles are set up on the outskirts of every community. The message carried skywards is “No more rain, please.”
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Poland-History.txt:None of these reforms pleased the Russians and Prussians, who continued to covet Polish territory. Russia invaded Poland and in 1792-1793 it, along with Prussia, imposed a second partition of Poland, annulling the constitution and essentially divying up the country between them. Tadeusz Ko§ciuszko, a hero of the American War of Independence, led a military insurrection in 1794, defeating the Russians with a mostly peasant army. The uprising was quashed, however, and in 1795, Poniatowski was forced to abdicate. A third partition crushed Poland and placed the country under the control of Austria, Prussia, and Russia. Poland ceased to exist — its very name was abolished by treaty — for the next 123 years. Warsaw went to Prussia, Kraków to Austria.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Poland-WhatToDo.txt:The demise of Communism in 1989 and the move to a free-market economy have had a dramatic impact on Poland as a shopping destination. Drab state-owned stores are a thing of the past. The dollar and mark (and other currencies) don’t go as far today as they once did, but foreign visitors and their Polish counterparts can only be pleased with the opening of trade and vastly improved selection of goods on the market. In major cities like Warsaw and Kraków, Poland doesn’t lag far behind Western Europe and North America for commercial opportunities. Even with the end of Communism and inflation, Poland remains considerably cheaper than Western European destinations.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Portugal-WhatToDo.txt:Though Portugal has grown considerably more modern and cosmopolitan over the last two decades, it continues to excel at traditional crafts. Small shops and outdoor markets across the country feature intricate works of gold and silver, handpainted ceramics, and classic wool rugs. Other shoppers will be pleased by the sprouting of chic fashion and jewelry boutiques in Lisbon and Porto, as well as wine shops and cellars stocking Portugal’s famous fortified wines. Relative to other European countries, many consumer goods remain somewhat cheaper in Portugal. 
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Vallarta-WhatToDo.txt:Still, the malecón rules when it comes to sheer rowdy nighttime fun. Along with the longstanding Carlos O’Brians, several open-air bars and dance clubs stay open until 5am, and a new Cuban restaurant-bar pleases patrons with authentic food and live music nightly until 3am. Just a few blocks in back of the malecón are a growing collection of unique clubs with a more urban edge. Among them is La Cantina, a hipper version of a Mexican classic. By day it serves classic cantina fare, by night it clamors with the sound of conversation mixed with the best in contemporary recorded Mexican music. Board games are available for play.
