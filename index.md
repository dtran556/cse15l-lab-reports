# Week 1 Lab Report
**By Daniel Tran**

In this week we learned about setting up Vs Code, logging into our course specific ieng account and trying out commands on the remote server.

To do all of this we can break this down into 4 parts.

# Part 1: Installing Vs Code
First you must install VS Code by going to this link [VsCode Page](https://code.visualstudio.com) and follow the page's instructions to install the program based on your computer system.

Once you are finished installing it you it should look like this when you open the program:

# Part 2: Setting up your CSE 15L Account
To find your account you go to this link : [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) and fill out your information and set up your account by assigning the account a password. If you are struggling to give the account a password follow the instructions on this page : [Reset Password Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit).
After you have sucessfully set up your account you have to wait up to a few minutes for your account to be set up properly.

# Part 3: Remotely connecting to the server
Depending on your operating system, connecting to servers for the first time will be different. If you have windows you must first download git and then go to your terminal and type   ```git bash```.
This next part will be the same for Windows OS or Mac OS, you then go to terminal and type this ```ssh cs15lwi23xyz@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` with the "xyz" part corresponding to your own specific CSE 15L account.
If it is your first time you will get a message asking you if you still want to connect even though it cannot verify the authenticity of the server, you should enter yes and you are in.
It should look like this when you get in: ![Image](/images/cse15lServer.png)

# Part 4: Trying out commands
