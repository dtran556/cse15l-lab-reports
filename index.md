# Lab Report 4:
### By Daniel Tran


In this lab report we are going to talk about logging into ieng6, cloning and forking a repository on GitHub, running the junit tests, going into the the file and finding the bug in the code that is producing the error and fixing it, re-running the junit test and committing and pushing the changes to GitHub.

### Step 1: Signing into ieng6
To log into my ieng6 account I typed <ssh cs15lwi23aun@ieng6.ucsd.edu> and pressed <enter> which automatically logged me into the remote server because I added my github ssh key to my account.


### Step 2: Forking and cloning from the repository on GitHub

  


### Step 3: Running the JUnit tests


### Step 4: Going into the java file and editing the code


### Step 5: Running the Junit tests again


### Step 6: Commiting and pushing on to GitHub
