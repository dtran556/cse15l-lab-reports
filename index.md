### Lab Report 4:
By Daniel Tran
In this lab report we are going to talk about logging into ieng6, cloning and forking a repository on GitHub, running the junit tests, going into the the file and finding the bug in the code that is producing the error and fixing it, re-running the junit test and committing and pushing the changes to GitHub.
